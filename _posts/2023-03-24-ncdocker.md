# Install NextCloud Pi with Docker Compose

## Install Docker

Update the repo to get latest versions

```bash
sudo apt update
```

Install the latest version

```bash
sudo apt install docker.io
```

Set Docker to start on startup

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
```

Give your user permissions to docker, replacing user with your username

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker user
```

Once you have run this command close and reopen your session if you accessing remotely. This is to apply the permissions in the above step

Test it has installed correctly by getting the docker version

```bash
docker --version
```

## Docker Compose

I also install docker-compose as some dockers need you to compose from a yml file. This downloads v2.16.0, just change this if the version updates to a later version

```bash
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.16.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

Give permissions to this

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

Test it has installed correctly by getting the docker-compose version

```bash
docker-compose --version
```

## Install Nextcloud

I keep all my dockers in a dockers folder in my home directory. If it doesn’t exist already, create this folder:-

```bash
mkdir ~/dockers
```

Now create a folder for Nextcloud to live in.

```bash
mkdir ~/dockers/nextcloud ~/dockers/
```

Create a folder for the www data

```bash
mkdir ~/dockers/nextcloud/data  
```

Create a folder for the database

```bash
mkdir ~/dockers/nextcloud/sqldata  
```

Change directory to this folder

```bash
cd ~/dockers/nextcloud
```

Create a docker-compose.yml file

```bash
nano docker-compose.yml
````

Paste the following. Change the 8081 part of 8081:80 if you want it to listen on an alternative port to port 8081. Change the MYSQL_PASSWORD and MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD. Ch

```yml
---
version: '2'

services:
  app:
    image: nextcloud
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 8081:80
    volumes:
      - ./data:/var/www/html
    environment:
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=nextcloud
      - MYSQL_USER=nextclouduser
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=changeme
      - MYSQL_HOST=db
  db:
    image: mariadb
    restart: always
    command: --transaction-isolation=READ-COMMITTED --binlog-format=ROW
    volumes:
      - ./sqldata:/var/lib/mysql
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=pleasechangeme
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=changeme
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=nextcloud
      - MYSQL_USER=nextcloud
```

Save the file with ctl + x, then y to save.

Run the docker-compose file with the following:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Browse to the server ip and the port mentioned in the compose file, eg http://1.1.1.1:8081 and you should get the default page.

## Finishing Up

Add your domain to trusted_domains

```bash
sudo nano ~/dockers/nextcloud/data/config/config.php
```

Under trusted_domains, add your url so it looks like this

```bash
‘trusted_domains’ => array ( 0 => ‘nextcloud.example.com’, ),
```

Once on the site, create an admin account, open storage and database, and paste your data folder into there from the docker redirect. This will make files appear in ~/dockers/nextcloud/data/data folder

```bash
/var/www/html/data
```

Add the nextcloud database settings.

```
nextcloud
password
nextcloud
localhost
```

Press finish setup.
